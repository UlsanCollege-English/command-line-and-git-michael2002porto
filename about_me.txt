Hello, my name is Michael Natanael. I am currently participating in the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) program at Ulsan College for one semester. I am a helpful person, always want to help others while I can do it, and I am very interested to learning new things to improve my abilities and skills. I have experience with many programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Java, Python, and R language. I have interest in data science and artificial intelligence.

Since vocational high school, I have been passionate about technology and have actively pursued learning about it. My academic goal is to deepen my knowledge and skills in Information and Technology (Global ICT). I enjoy learning about the latest technologies and their applications in innovation and problem-solving in large-scale manufacturing industries. I am excited to learn from the great lecturers and collaborate with other students on research projects. I am also impressed by the complete facilities and resources that Ulsan College provides for its students, such as the computer labs, libraries, student clubs, and others.

After completing my studies at Ulsan College, I expect to have new insights into technology and practical skills in the industry. I also want to build good relations with fellow local and international students, esteemed lecturers, and industry professionals. I believe that these relationships will open doors for further education opportunities through scholarships or potential employment in prominent companies.
